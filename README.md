What is generalized nxn sudoku?
In this version of the game, if n is not prime, then two factors p,q are taken to make the square from pxq rectangles/subboxes. The rules of sudoku are from here on easily applied.

How is this implemented?
The sudoku solver uses the Glucose3 model from PySat. The encoding as of now is a fairly direct encoding. (detailed document will be released soon.)
